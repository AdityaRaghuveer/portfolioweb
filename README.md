# Portfolio Website

Welcome to my **Portfolio Website**!

This website showcases:
- **Who I am**
- **What I do**
- **My interests**
- **My skills**
- **How you can reach out to me**

This is basically an **online resume** of mine.

When you open this site, youâ€™ll find a complete overview about me â€” including my background, projects, skills, and contact information. I will be recieving responses through **formspree** instead of using PHP, firebase or Mongodb for backend . whenever a cllient tries to reach me I will get a notification to registered mail used in the formspree (formid which i have used in code).
